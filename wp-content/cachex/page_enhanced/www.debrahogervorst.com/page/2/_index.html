                            							<p><a href="http://www.debrahogervorst.com/2012/03/i-cant-see-so-what-should-i-do/images-7-2/" rel="attachment wp-att-527"><img class="alignleft size-thumbnail wp-image-527" title="images-7" src="http://www.debrahogervorst.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/03/images-7-150x150.jpg" alt="" width="150" height="150" /></a>I have become all to familiar with the verse from John which reveals to us that Jesus only did what He saw the Father doing.  But, lately I have wondered if my interpretation of it is accurate.  I hear it quoted ALL THE TIME and I find myself feeling discouraged at times, and troubled when I question what that should look like in my own life.  If the truth sets us free then why am I not feeling liberated?</p>
<blockquote><p>John 5:19 says, &#8220;So Jesus explained, &#8220;I tell you the truth, the Son can do nothing by himself. He does only what he sees the Father doing. Whatever the Father does, the Son also does.&#8221;</p></blockquote>
<p>When I read this verse I picture Jesus walking along looking up to heaven watching a video screen type thing playing out for Him all that the Father is doing so He can then do it on earth.  This is a bit exaggerated, but I wonder how many others think this way too.  I know my friend Kristina does because we have talked about it recently.  In my own life, I have tried looking up to see what God is doing before I do something.  I have even prayed for more faith to see all that Jesus supposedly saw, just like He saw it.  But still I look up and see the clouds and the sky, no video screen.  My heart desires to know what the Father is doing so that I can do it here and now.  In fact, because of this I often feel that I lack in my own ability to discern what the Father is doing and therefore I question if it is okay for me to pray for someone or if I should intervene in some way or not.  What a confusing mess!!!  Can you relate to this at all?</p>
<p>Feeling like I needed to come to a place of peace with all of this I decided to look up original Greek word for &#8216;see&#8217; in John 5:19.  The word used there is: <strong>βλέπῃ</strong>(blepe).  This specific form of the word &#8216;see&#8217; is used only once in the Bible.  It is translated as the word &#8216;see&#8217; but it actually means &#8216;he might perceptively-see&#8221;.  So I looked up the word &#8216;perceptive&#8217; and it is defined, &#8220;having or showing keenness of insight, understanding, or intuition.&#8221;  I am now starting to feel some relief as my own understanding is being enlightened to this perceptive eye Jesus had of all the Father was doing.</p>
<p>When we perceive something we become aware of, know, or identify by means of the senses.  Jesus knew the Father&#8217;s heart and since He had co-existed with the Father for eternity prior to coming to earth, He<strong> knew</strong> the nature of the Father.  He <strong>knew</strong> His Father was good.  He <strong>knew</strong> of His Father&#8217;s great love for all people.  He had tasted and had seen the GOODNESS of God.  Jesus was able to perceive and do all that the Father would want done on earth because of this.  He did not walk around looking up to the heavens seeing and doing only that which He saw the Father doing literally.  He perceived and did what He knew God would do.</p>
<p>If you have ever wondered about this verse, I hope that this writing brings clarity and will release you to <strong>do</strong> as Jesus did in the authority He has given you to heal the sick, raise the dead, cleanse lepers, and cast out demons.  (Matthew 8:10)   If you long to know more of the Father&#8217;s heart as Jesus did, ask Him to reveal His heart and His goodness to you.  The Scriptures are full of the the goodness of God and He longs to reveal His heart to every believer.  Jesus&#8217; 3 1/2 years of ministry constantly revealed this goodness to a dark world.  I suggest Mark Stibbe&#8217;s excellent book called, &#8220;<em>The 100 Verse Bible: The Essence of the World&#8217;s Most Popular Book&#8221;</em>.  It reveals the Father&#8217;s true heart and character to the reader.</p>
<p>I bless you as you pursue and walk out this greater revelation.  We are blessed with all spiritual blessings and lack no thing, nothing.</p>
<blockquote><p>Psalm 27:13 says: &#8220;I am still confident of this: I will see the goodness of the Lord in the land of the living.&#8221;</p></blockquote>

Life. Now.</strong>  What does this even mean is what you might be asking?  After all, we live and breathe day to day, we wake up in the morning and go to sleep every night.  We do what we have to do to live a good, decent life.  I have lived this way for many years and I can no longer ignore the little voice inside of me that screams, &#8220;There has got to be more than this!!!&#8221;</p>
<p>I know I am not the only one who craves to live an amazing life because I believe God put within each one of us everything we need to be absolutely amazing.  After all, He created us in His image, in his likeness, and then He breathed His life into us so He could enjoy us being alive like He meant for us to be.  The sad thing is this, when I look around me, I don&#8217;t see a lot of life-ful people around.  Today I am at UCSD sitting in Perks Coffee shop and as I look around me I see sadness, loneliness, tiredness, blah-ness, etc.  I can even hear minds asking, &#8220;Why am I even here?&#8221; and &#8220;What am I doing all this for?&#8221;  You get the picture.  So now I begin to wonder this: &#8220;Is this what God sees and feels too?&#8221;  I think He does and I know He is at work to reveal to all of us that there is a life available to us that is more than we can even begin to imagine.  Sounds familiar right?  Ephesians 3:20 says, &#8220;Now to Him who is able to do exceedingly abundantly above all that we ask or think, according to the power that works in us.&#8221;  This is the heart of our God and Father who created us and who lives within us.</p>
<p>Do you hear the voice inside of you that is thinking there must be more to life than you are experiencing now?  Do you long for purpose and worth?   Significance?  Sometimes we keep so busy and find ourselves so worn down that we don&#8217;t even hear that sound anymore.  But I am here to tell you that it is in you because you were created for purpose and you are wired to live an exceptional life.  This is what living <strong>Real. Life. Now</strong> is all about.  We do not have to wait to achieve a certain status or place in life so that real life can kick in.  We can have it here and we can have it now.  Ephesians 3:20 says that <strong>God is able to do exceedingly abundantly above all we ask or think.</strong>   He is able to do this and He wants to do this.  We just have to believe this and agree to work with Him.  Everywhere we go and every person we encounter is a possible candidate for God to do above and beyond what we can think or imagine.  But, we have to begin to think this way and be intentional about it.  God is everywhere and He is in all things, it is His desire that ALL know Him and the real life He meant for us.</p>
<p>Take a moment&#8230; think about your day or evening ahead&#8230;ask yourself if you are willing to be intentional so God can live abundantly through you.  He wants to and He is more than able.  He made you to reflect Him and He has blessed you with every spiritual blessing from the heavenly realms. (Eph.1:3)  He is the epitome of abundant life and He is gracious in every way to show you how to live this <strong>Real. Life. Now.</strong></p>

Life. Now</strong>. until you allow the emotional part of you to come alive.  I am writing this right now from a place of deep pain, not because of rejection or a relationship gone bad, but because I have opened up my heart to really love&#8230;and sometimes love can really hurt.</p>
<p>My nephew Joel is a quadriplegic.  For the past two months I have had the opportunity to drive him to school on Wednesdays and spend the day with him.  It has been such an amazing time for both of us.  God is doing great things and is revealing Himself to us in new ways.  This year God has been stressing to me the importance of relationship so I have embraced this opportunity and have been so blessed.  I have felt so much joy as I have been able to watch God use what I have learned to help someone else.  I really look forward to my Wednesdays.</p>
<p>The deep pain I am feeling tonight is because Joel is in pain right now.  I hurt because he hurts.  He is in the hospital and everything about his situation is a big question mark.  So he is hurting, wondering if everything will turn out okay.  I visited him tonight and as I left my heart felt like it was breaking, being torn.  I could do nothing to help him, I couldn&#8217;t fix anything, even my words seemed to lack.  As I walked out to meet up with my friends who had come with me, I let the tears fall and I allowed myself to feel the pain.  It hurt.  I believe I have realized what it means to be moved by compassion.</p>
<p>In the midst of this pain the Father reminded me that Jesus was moved by compassion and many of his miracles resulted from this.  It has been my heart&#8217;s desire to see God heal people for many years.  I have seen awesome things &#8211; which I praise God for &#8211; but I yearn for so much more.  Everywhere I go I see the hurting and the sick.  I desire to do the greater things that Jesus promised us we would do in John 14;12, which says, &#8220;I tell you the truth, anyone who has faith in me will do what I have been doing. He will do even greater things than these, because I am going to the Father.&#8221; (NIV)  If Jesus is the perfect example of the life we can attain, then we need to know and believe we will do greater things He spoke of.</p>
<p>As He ministered while here on earth, he was time and again &#8216;moved by compassion.&#8217;  The result of this was that people&#8217;s lives were powerfully touched and made whole.  Here are a few verses to illustrate this:</p>
<blockquote><p>Moved with compassion, Jesus reached out and touched him. &#8220;I am willing,&#8221; he said. &#8220;Be healed!&#8221;  Mark 1:41 NLT</p>
<p>Moved with compassion, Jesus touched their eyes; and immediately they regained their sight and followed Him.  Matthew 20:34 NASV</p>
<p>And when Jesus went out He saw a great multitude; and He was moved with compassion for them, and healed their sick.  Mattew 14:14 NKJV</p></blockquote>
<p>If through being moved by compassion Jesus healed the sick, don&#8217;t you think we can expect the same thing?  Take a moment, picture Jesus moving through a crowd and being moved with compassion.  Have you ever felt true compassion?  Try to remember a time right now.  To fully understand and visualize Jesus healing the sick we need to comprehend this, we need to relate to this first hand.  Jesus was moved, he was pierced with the pain of compassion.  He felt their pain and it hurt!</p>
<p>I am deeply stirred by this and know that God is going to show me more in the days to come.  If you have realized through reading this that you have shut yourself off from feeling what others feel, all you have to do is ask God to restore this in you and He will.  What He has done for me He will do for you.  He is your Restorer.  He worked mightily through the emotions Jesus felt and He desires to work mightily through yours too because He desires you to live and experience <strong>Real. Life. Now.  </strong>Go for it!<strong><br />

                            							<p><a href="http://www.debrahogervorst.com/2012/02/onelifetolive/gods-law-vs-mans-law/" rel="attachment wp-att-448"><img class="alignleft  wp-image-448" title="gods-law-vs-mans-law" src="http://www.debrahogervorst.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/02/gods-law-vs-mans-law.png" alt="" width="202" height="202" /></a>I often hear people say that real everyday life gets in the way of the spiritual life they want to live.  They describe moments of deep intimacy with God but then that dissipates because the dishes have to be done, a child needs attention, the laundry has to be folded, a neighbor stops by to talk.., etc.  You get the point.  Life will always be full of interruptions but that doesn&#8217;t mean we move from operating out of the spiritual realm and into the natural/physical realm.  This type of thinking stems from Greek philosophy and goes against how God created us to exist.</p>
<p>When we begin to classify things we do as being spiritual and non spiritual, we fall quite easily into thinking the spiritual things we do are good and the things we must do in the natural/physical world are then lesser or even bad.  This is wrong and leads us down a dangerous road that is bumpy and tosses us back and forth between two worlds that were meant to be one.  In Hebrew culture they did not divide their spiritual life from their physical life.  There was only one world that God created, not two as many think today: the physical world and spiritual world.  In the Old Testament and in Hebrew culture they saw God intervene and exist in the visible and invisible realms.   Differentiating between the two came with the Greek mindset and was then exposed to the new Christians who interpreted the Scriptures and was then taught to the new converts.</p>
<p>For most of my life I had this type of dualistic mindset.  I viewed my time spent with God, whether I was worshiping, reading the Bible, or serving Him, as spiritual and worthwhile.  But I then saw my daily life activities of being a mom, keeping my home, going to all my kids&#8217; sporting events, etc., as UN-spiritual and less than.  I became quite unhappy and inner-focused as I viewed my life through these lenses.  I even believed God was unhappy with me and my choices.  This is so wrong and this line of thought does not come from God, it is from the pit of hell.  You see if we separate what God created to be one, we open doors of condemnation and shame, missing out on the Divine intervention we were created to walk with.  He is in everything!</p>
<p>The truth is He delights in you as you go about your daily activities.  He is with you and will interact with you regardless of your whereabouts.  You can be at the gym, at the grocery store, at church, or at a Bible study and God may deem this as a perfect opportunity to intervene in your life and reveal Himself.  I was mopping my floor one day and God poured out His presence on me and let me know how much He loved me taking care of my home.  My laundry room is a sanctuary of God&#8217;s presence since I spend so much time there meeting the clothing needs of my family.  He meets me where I am at.  I do not have to forsake the everyday things of life and seclude myself in my prayer closet or attend 5 church services a week in order to know Him and be known by Him.  He rewards those who seek Him and delights in us as we seek Him with all of our hearts in every part of our lives.  There is no place we can go to escape His presence.  He is everywhere.</p>
<p>Take a moment and evaluate how you view your life.  Do you separate and list things as being spiritual and nonspiritual.  If you do, I challenge you to put away wrong thinking and pursue truth, God is in you and with you 24/7.  He longs to be your everything.  Acknowledge God in every part of your life and you will experience new found freedom leading you into<strong> Real. Life. Now.  </strong><strong><br />

                            							<p><a href="http://www.debrahogervorst.com/2012/02/be-witched-or-be-blessed/images-5-2/" rel="attachment wp-att-435"><img class="alignleft size-thumbnail wp-image-435" title="images-5" src="http://www.debrahogervorst.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/02/images-5-150x150.jpg" alt="" width="150" height="150" /></a>Last week I wrote a blog showing how negative thinking can keep us from <strong>Real. Life. Now</strong>.  Today I want to expose a more specific line of thought that can hinder us as well.  I would like to ask if you have ever had moments or days where you are inundated with negative thoughts about a particular person or situation?  It doesn&#8217;t matter if the thoughts are true or not, that&#8217;s irrelevant.  You might find yourself rehearsing conversations in your mind with people who have hurt you or offended you or your imagination takes over and you prepare yourself for something that may never even happen.  You might even think you are the ONLY one who struggles with this.  I want to assure you that you are not alone at all.</p>
<p>As a kid I used to watch cartoons and sometimes there would be scenes of witches brewing spells to cast on their victims.  It was quite innocently portrayed but I remember these spells would greatly affect the mind and thoughts of the victim.  They would begin to think thoughts that were not their own.  I believe this is what happens to us when the swirl of tumultuous thoughts bombard our minds.  We become bewitched and fall prey to this subtle form of witchcraft that consumes our minds with negative thoughts, fear, confusion, suspicion, etc.   Often we get hit with shame and condemnation because we cannot seem to shake ourselves free of the all consuming negative thinking.  It is a vicious cycle.  But I am here to tell you that it is not you and there is something you can do to break free of this cycle.</p>
<p>The good news is this, what we can identify we can overcome.  So if we identify the chaos of thoughts and realize we have come under an attack we can apply the right tools to get rid of them.  As I wrote in my previous blog, &#8220;No More Negatives&#8221;, a powerful way to negate these thoughts is to bless the person or situation with good and powerful words of blessing.  Identify the situation and come against it with blessing.  Too often we fall in even deeper when we try to analyze and figure out which thoughts are even true.  We just need to put a stop to the thoughts and pronounce the blessing.  If there is witchcraft involved you will know because you will not <strong>want</strong> to bless the person, but in order to overcome the negative thinking you <strong>must</strong>.  It may be hard at first but it will get easier and easier every time you do it.</p>
<p>Now this past week as I applied this understanding to other situations I found it worked every time.  One of the greatest things I love about this is that it does not glorify the enemy one bit.  It empowers you and dis-empowers him!  You end up reaping what you sow, so if you sow blessing you will reap blessing.  Take a moment to think about your own life.  Have you in the past or are you currently experiencing this kind of negative thinking?  I encourage you to apply blessing and be set free from all that is bewitching you.  It is not you, it is the enemy&#8217;s attempt to destroy you and bring division.  Rise up, speak blessings and be set free.  Free to be you and free to enjoy <strong>Real. Life. Now.</strong></p>
<p>So I ask you this question:  Would you like to be-witched or be blessed!  The choice is yours.</p>
